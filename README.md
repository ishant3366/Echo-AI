### üöÄ The Problem: Operator-Dependent Cardiac Diagnosis

Echocardiography is the primary tool for cardiac assessment, but its interpretation is highly subjective. Manual analysis of cardiac biomarkers like **Ejection Fraction (EF)** is time-consuming, suffers from significant inter-observer variability, and requires expert clinicians. This bottleneck can delay critical diagnoses and treatment for patients with heart disease.

### ‚ú® The Solution: Deep Learning-Powered Automation

Echo-AI is an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to automate the analysis of 2D echocardiography (echo) cine-loops. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision models, it extracts vital clinical biomarkers **instantly, accurately, and consistently**, empowering clinicians to make faster, data-driven decisions.

## üîë Key Features

*   **Automated Chamber Segmentation:** Precisely segments the left ventricle (LV) across all frames using a trained U-Net model.
*   **Biomarker Extraction:** Automatically calculates **Ejection Fraction (EF), Stroke Volume (SV), and Fractional Shortening (FS)** from segmented volumes.
*   **Wall Motion Analysis:** Utilizes optical flow techniques to track myocardial motion and identify regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA).
*   **Clinically Relevant Output:** Generates comprehensive reports, including a bull's-eye plot for wall motion scoring and key quantitative metrics.
*   **Robust Preprocessing:** Handles the noise and variability inherent in ultrasound data through advanced image preprocessing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
*   **Models:** U-Net (Segmentation), RAFT / Farneback (Optical Flow)
*   **Image Processing:** OpenCV, SciKit-Image
*   **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas, DICOM
*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run inference on a sample echo video:**
    ```bash
    python src/inference/predict.py --input path/to/your/video.dcm
    ```
